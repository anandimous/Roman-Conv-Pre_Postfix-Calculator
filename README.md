## Description ##

A C program that reads from a file (filename.IN), interprets the input as an infix 
arithmetic expression, and writes to a file (filename.OUT) the prefix form of the 
expression, the postfix form of the expression, and the value of the expression, as 
shown in the following examples.

NOTE: This is my first attempt at C and thus, the code is not optimally developed
